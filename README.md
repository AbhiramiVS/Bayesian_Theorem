# Bayesian_Theorem
This repository implements Gaussian Bayesian classifier from scratch.

Bayesian Theorem,
P(w/X)=  (P(X/w)  P(w))/P(X) 

X denotes the feature and w denotes the class.

P(w) is the prior probability of event w,

P(X/w) is the likelihood probability of X occurring given that event w has occurred,

P(X) is the marginal probability of event X occurring, marginal probability refers to the probability of particular event happening without considering any other events. It focuses on individual probability of a single event,

P(w/X) is the posterior probability, which represents the updated probability of event w happening given that event X has occurred.

Here I have used wine dataset from sklearn as data for python implementation from scratch.
